# scala-contracts-client
Angular2/Google [Image ]Charts Web client for scala-contracts

The three main components of the project are 
* contracts engine, 
* server, 
* client. 

The engine is written in Scala; server - Scala/Lift, and the client is Angular2 Single-Page Application.

The client demo is deployed on http://scala-contracts-client.appspot.com. It is finished at 85%, but it already demonstrates a number of techniques and technical decisions:

Angular2 forms and components;
Typescript and es6;
Usage of charting libraries: graphviz via Google Image Charts, and Line charts from Google Charts packages.
